Hey, I watched a lot of your videos before and thus was pleasantly surprised to see a new upload after a year.
Unsure if appropriate to send this here but had a question. I’m a current electrical and computer engineering freshman at NEU (which was a weird coincidence). Currently having thoughts about switching to CS.
I share concerns about the cs job market, the sheer competitive nature amongst students to get internships and co-op culture seem so daunting, it may overshadow my passion for cs. In 2023, there were 112,720 bachelor degrees awarded, which is more than double than in 2013. This number seems to only be increasing. However, my fear could be compounded by doom scrolling on reddit and hearing the chatter of nearby cs students complain about co-op applications. 
On the other hand, engineering seems much more stable, with only 26,000 graduates per year.  at the risk of lower salaries and slightly worse work life balances. I enjoy both majors pretty equally (3% biased towards cs), however haven’t had enough experience in my freshman year to generate a solid decision. 

In summary, what are your thoughts on the future of the computer science job market, especially coming from a NEU graduate. 
I apologize if this was an amateurish question surrounding a topic done to death, however any perspective is helpful. 

Thanks

PS: A video ranking college majors would help me out honestly lol, or a video about why you choose to do a masters degree.
